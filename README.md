# Avengers unite!

## Goals
The new wave of nearly unbeatable enemies are here and we need to build our Avengers squad! 

First things first, we need to establish our first Avenger!
While this is highly debated as to who was the original Avenger, we are going to go off of the idea that Nick Fury decide to form the squad after his experience with Carol 'Avenger' Danvers, or you might know her as "Captain Marvel".
